?: Snake from Metal Gear Solid (??)


For: K3 - Happy Bithday! I still owe you a skin for last year. Thanks for being a classic from the text book adik :P Work hard on the exams this year!


Invisible: balance, state buttons (the top right corner buttons)

Components:
=fully skinned, no cursors.
- Font is Times New Roman

The skin:
Skin #13. For buttons on EQ, when it is brighter this indicates an off or not in use. In the main window, a darker color indicates this.


Behind the skin:
I don't know this game very well, so it is quite possible that I have mis-identified the character.... I hope not.... Snake is in both the first and second Metal Gear Solid, right? The pic was named mgs2.... ahh nvm ^^;; 

Compared to Interference 01 this is a very simple skin, nothing fancy at all. I do like the way the whole picture came together though. As usual I have problems with the play list. But then *cough* the end result of this skin seems better than Interference 01......

lol in the course of skinning, I wondered who will win in a fight in the forest (the background is that of a forest): Snake or Legolas?  *shakes head* too little sleep, too much LOTR (hey niichan, want an Elf lady skin?). 

Skin name is based on the bgm of the same name from Command and Conquer.

Revised: Added a simple avs and mini browser just so that I can submit to winamp.com -_-;;
